### Just One Want

Every story's main character has just one want. You're the main character of your own life. So the only question is:  what's your one want?

You can only have 1 at a time, and you must state it simply enough that a child can understand.

Then, once there's enough main characters in our database, we can connect people based on their wants. Because isn't that what life's all about? Helping each other?

And what's better than putting two people together where each person's want gets fulfilled?

The only thing better...is pockets.
